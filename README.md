# Convolutional neural network
Very simplistic machine learning python program, that trains computer on a set of data of dogs and cats so that it can recognize dogs and cats in other images. By commenting out the block of code that trains the model from scratch, you'll be able to test out the model I've already train(All the object data is stored in the .h5 file :D).

* You're going to need the following python modules to run this script(updated too, will make links soon or installation methods) - keras,pandas, sklearn, tensorflow, matlibplot and numpy
* You can add you add the dir of the image into my own code to test if it works.
* The .h5 files is very important it's used to store object data.
* Very detailed explanation will be given soon(I hope you know your stats and maths :D).
* Will upload training data and testing data to google drive. (For training the model from scratch).
