# Simple_classifier
Basic binary classification using CNN. Uses a CNN model to classify images based on the two labels - Dog and Cat. By commenting out the block of code that trains the model from scratch, you'll be able to test out the model I've already trained(All the object data is stored in the .h5 file :D).

* You're going to need the following python modules to run this script(updated too, will make add soon or installation methods) - keras,pandas, sklearn, tensorflow, matlibplot and numpy
* You can add your the dir of the image into the code to test if it works.
* The .h5 files is very important it's used to store object data.
* Very detailed explanation will be given soon(I hope you know your stats and maths :D).
* Will upload training data and testing data to google drive. (For training the model from scratch).
